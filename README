PURPOSE
  This code was written for a Distributed Systems course homework assignment.

SOURCE CODE
  The source code is divided up into RPC client specific, RPC server specific,
  and common parts -- each part placed into its appropriate folder.
  
  common/SimpleNetworking.* contain a simple wrapper for BSD sockets.
  
  The RemoteProcedureId enumeration in common/RpcConnection.h should contain a
  separate id for each implemented remote procedure.
  That file also contains wrappers for integral and floating point types. These
  wrappers are used automatically when sending single values from the client to
  the server.
  
  The RpcConnection.* files contain the actual library implementation.
  
  The Procedures.* files contain the parts of the procedures as appropriate on
  each side (currently for four example procedures).
  
  The server/RpcConnection.cpp file contains the procedure dispatch code: it has
  to be modified when adding/removing remote procedures.
  
  The main.cpp files contain a sample RPC application.
